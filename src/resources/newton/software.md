#Module system

Newton uses a module system to organize installed software

To check the avialable modules use the command
```
module av
```

To check the modules that are currently loaded
```
module list
```

#Custom installation
If you need to install your own software please use the folder
`/tmp/` to compile your software. Do not compile in your home directory.
In case you are not sure on what to do, please [contact](../../support.md) the system administrator.
